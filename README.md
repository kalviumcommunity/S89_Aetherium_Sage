Aetherium Sage is an immersive, text-based role-playing game (RPG) where an advanced AI acts as your personal Dungeon Master (DM), creating a dynamic and deeply personalized adventure with a soothing and narrative-focused feel. Unlike traditional games with predefined paths, Aetherium Sage crafts a unique story that unfolds based on your choices, making you the true author of your journey.[1]
The experience is designed to be highly interactive and replayable. Every decision, from how you speak to a mysterious stranger to the path you choose in a dark forest, shapes the world and the characters within it.[1][2] The AI Dungeon Master adapts the narrative in real-time, ensuring that no two adventures are ever the same.[3]
Here’s how the core technologies come together to create this unique experience:
System and User Prompts: The foundation of the game lies in the carefully crafted System Prompt, which establishes the AI's persona as the "Aetherium Sage." This prompt sets the serene, story-rich tone of the game and outlines the initial setting and your role within it. The User Prompts are your actions—anything you can imagine saying or doing—giving you complete freedom to interact with the world.[4]
Tuning Parameters: To ensure the adventure aligns with your preferences, you can adjust several Tuning Parameters. A "Creativity" slider can make the storyteller stick to classic fantasy or veer into unpredictable territory. You can also select the "Tone" of the adventure, from "Relaxing & Calm" to "Mysterious & Eerie," allowing you to customize the emotional landscape of your story.
Structured Output: To maintain a coherent and evolving world, the AI uses Structured Output (like JSON) behind the scenes. This allows the Dungeon Master to keep track of your character's stats, inventory, relationships with other characters, and the overall state of the game world, ensuring consistency across long play sessions.[5]
Function Calling: The Sage can interact with external tools through Function Calling to bring the world to life.[6] It can perform actions like roll_dice() for skill checks, generate_image() to create visuals of stunning landscapes or intriguing characters, and fetch_lore() to provide deeper insights into the world's history, making the experience more dynamic and immersive.[7][8]
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The heart of the world's depth lies in RAG. A vast, pre-written library of lore—detailing the history, locations, and legends of the game's world—is accessible to the AI.[9] When you ask about an ancient ruin or a mythical creature, the RAG system retrieves the correct information, allowing the Sage to provide rich, consistent, and engaging narrative details, making the world feel ancient and alive.
